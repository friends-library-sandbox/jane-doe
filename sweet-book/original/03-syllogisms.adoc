== Syllogisms

But the apostle puts this controversy out of doubt, for,
if we may believe his plain assertion,
he tells us that some Gentiles indeed "`did the things contained in the law.`"
From all of which I argue as follows:

[.syllogism]
* In most-every nation, he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted.
* But some of the heathen did fear God, and wrought righteousness by Him.
* Therefore they were accepted.

Can there be anything more clear?
And this appears even more plain by another verse,
taken out of the same chapter (v. 13).
The words are, "`The doers of the Law shall be justified.`"
From which I thus argue, from plain Scripture:

[.syllogism]
* The doers of the Law shall be justified
* But some of the Gentiles did the things contained in the Law,
showing that the work of the Law was written in their hearts.^
footnote:[Romans 2:15]
* Therefore these were justified.

Paul, through that whole chapter,
labors as if he were contending now with our adversaries,
in order to confirm this doctrine.
He says, "`Tribulation and anguish on most-every soul of man who does evil,
of the Jew first and also of the Gentile; but glory, honor,
and peace to everyone who works what is good,
to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
For there is no partiality with God.`"
